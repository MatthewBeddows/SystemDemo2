[System] Magnet System
The Magnet System is the core component of an MRI machine, responsible for generating a stable and homogeneous magnetic field, which is essential for high-resolution MRI imaging. This system typically employs superconducting materials cooled to cryogenic temperatures to achieve the necessary field strength and stability.
